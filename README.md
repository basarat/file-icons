This is to consolidate file-icons for use in `alm`.

# Usage
With webpack:

```
require('fileicons');
```
Now you get to use the fonts
```
mfizz
icomoon
devicons
octicons
fileicons
```

## Upgrading
* Copy the font files from : https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons/tree/master/resources/fonts
All except font-awesome (which is already in alm). Also rename `fileicons`.
* Get octicons from https://octicons.github.com/ (and extract octicons.woff2 file)

## More

* Atom package : https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons
* Just the `fileicons` font : https://github.com/Alhadis/FileIcons
* Optimized `DevOpicons` font : https://github.com/Alhadis/DevOpicons
* Optimized `MFizz` font : https://github.com/Alhadis/MFixx
